        The universe of the <a hreg="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal 
        grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, 
        alive or dead, or "populated" or "unpopulated". Every cell interacts 
        with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, 
        vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following 
        transitions occur:
        <br>
        <br>
        Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by 
        underpopulation.
        <br>
        Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next 
        generation.
        <br>
        Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by 
        overpopulation.
       <br>
       Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, 
       as if by reproduction.
